Come relax with a friend and play a few rounds of tic-tac-toe. This is an interactive, two-player tic-tac-toe game finessed with some fun CSS.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I really enjoyed looking for ways to make the CSS pop. I was able to apply my first gif background and CSS box within the tictactoe boxes. It feels like a swimming pool in outer space.

## Lessons Learned

We worked as a team to get this project functioning. I learned the importance of having a team, and the benefits of having different people come together and combine their knowledge into a finished product. In the future, I want to explore adding a computer player option to this project.
